# Studdy-Buddy
Studdy Buddy is a web app created for the UVA CS3240 course project. Its purpose is to match UVA students with other students who are looking to study for a specific class on a given date. Users can find study partners by selecting a class they're in and starting a chat with another student. Negotiate a time to meet and you can schedule a study session together!
